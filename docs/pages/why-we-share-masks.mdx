# Why We Share Masks

We are a group of people who found each other through a mutual desire to provide respiratory protection to all who need and want it, especially when the resources we expect support from fail us. We all experience risk of poor air quality and disease from our workplaces, healthcare settings, necessary errands, and from the outdoor air. Our workplaces, healthcare facilities, local establishments, and government agencies should provide us with clean air, but in the meantime we, Charlotte Mask Bloc, are working to bridge that gap and help ourselves and anyone we connect with to stay safe.

We believe in solidarity and that trying not to infect others with potentially damaging disease is one of the easiest and most effective forms of solidarity you can do.
