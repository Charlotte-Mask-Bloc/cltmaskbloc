# Out of Service Area Requests

CLT Mask Bloc serves Mecklenburg County NC and the surrounding area, including: Anson, Cabarrus, Gaston, Iredell, Lincoln, Rowan & Union counties in NC and Chester, Lancaster & York counties in SC. If you are outside of this area, we’re sorry but we are unable to provide you with masks at this time.

If you will be in Mecklenburg County soon, and want to pick up masks, please email us at cltmaskbloc@gmail.com and we will arrange a meeting for you with one of our volunteers.

Below please find other resources which may be able to provide masks for you:

- If you’re in Western NC, fill out COVID Safe WNC’s [request form](https://linktr.ee/covidsafewnc).
- If you’re in the Triangle (Raleigh - Durham - Chapel Hill area) in NC, fill out Triangle Mask Bloc’s [request form](https://trianglemaskbloc.carrd.co/).

- If you’re near Greenville, SC fill out GVL SC Mask Bloc’s [request form](https://greenvillescmaskbloc.github.io/).
- If you’re in any NC or SC county in or outside of our service area, you may also ask your local Public Health department if they have free masks available: [List of Public Health depts by NC county](https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/contact/LHD), [List of Public Health clinics by SC county](https://dph.sc.gov/public/public-health-clinics).
- If you’re out of state, see if there is a Mask Bloc closer to you by checking the [COVID Action Map](https://covidactionmap.org/) or [MaskBloc.org](http://MaskBloc.org) listings. Also contact your local county Health department.
- If you can afford to purchase masks, we enthusiastically recommend Mask Bloc Seattle’s [Mask Buying Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dlZenZ2IAIsLlWptHJ-EB3zyCXRw7_-hk1Jf-zsNUzM).

Thank you for understanding that while we’d like to provide masks to everyone, our resources are limited at this time.
